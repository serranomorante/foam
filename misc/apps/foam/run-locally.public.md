# Instructions to run Foam project locally

Foam is an [open source project](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) which I use to write my personal notes in markdown format.

## Requisites

- Make sure your system has pandoc installed

    For arch linux
    
    ```sh
    sudo pacman -S pandoc
    ```

- Make sure your system has mermaid-filter installed
    
    ```sh
    npm install --global mermaid-filter
    ```

## Running

Go to this url to see your project running [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)

This is [another test](another-test.public.md)

And this is a [[wikilink]] so don't panic.

This is the second [[wikilink 2]] so don't panic again


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[wikilink]: wikilink.public.md "wikilink"
[wikilink 2]: <wikilink 2.public.md> "wikilink 2"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
